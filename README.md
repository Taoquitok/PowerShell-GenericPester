# PowerShell-StoredCredential README

- [ ] Write the readme

- [ ] Add a thank you to one of Vexx32's pester test for inspiring this

- [ ] Add notations to the test and example usage

- [ ] Not sure how possible this is, but maybe update functions that use this as a sub module to have examples that actually work, and have this collect and run examples from Get-Help
  - If this does work, it could potentially save writing separate tests files
    - Not sure how good/bad practice this would be, but this would be testing by design with the tests following the functions internally
